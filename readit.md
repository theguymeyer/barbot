# Bartender Robot

Feelin thirsty? Why dont you spend every summer obsessing over the same project until you get it perfectly... Introducing the Barbot, an autonomous bartender that won't charge you double for a watered down beverage.

But... how? Well this beauty is built on top the finest shelf Ikea has to offer, along with a custom bottle mount this bad boy can hold up to 5 bottles in a line. The main controller (mainFile_rev1) is an Arduino Uno that controls a Bipolar NEMA 17 to move the cup and a set of relays to power the solenoid valve the pneumatics. In order to get enough juice on the pouring action (something that for the life of me, I did not imagine would be so hard) is a 2-stroke pneumatic piston operating under 45 PSI of pressure, controlled by a 2-position 12V Solenoid Valve. The air channels are also equipt with a tunable flow restrictor to provide smooooooooth motion.

Well thats cool but how do I use it? The UI is displayed on an LCD mounted on top another Arduino Uno (yes... the budget was low). The user can scroll between the drink options, select their favourite and watch the bartender go to work.

Just like most of my excessively detailed projects, there are a total of 17 3D printed parts plus other custom elements!
